Mumbai: Across-the-board profit-taking ahead of the Budget pulled the sensex down by 938 points, or 1.9%, to 47,410 on Wednesday. Strong selling by foreign funds also spooked investors on Dalal Street. Data at the end of Wednesdayâs session data showed that foreign funds had net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 1,700 crore. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 271 points, or 1.9%, lower at 13,968. Wednesdayâs losses left both the sensex and Nifty negative for 2021 â The BSE index had ended 2020 at 47,751 points, and Nifty at 13,982. The strong selling failed to enthuse investors even after the IMF projected a double-digit GDP growth for India for 2021. In the evening, the US markets opened deep in the red with all the three leading indices â Dow Jones, S&P500 and Nasdaq â down over 1% ahead of the US Federal Reserveâs policy announcement later in the night. If the US indices close with major losses, that could again weigh on investor sentiment on Dalal Street on Thursday, market players here said. According to Kotak Securities EVP (head of fundamental research) Rusmik Oza, the dayâs strong slide was likely due to profit-booking by foreign funds and other participants in the F&O segment as Thursday is the monthly expiry. âSome unwinding of positions is visible before the Budget event. Volatility is normally higher on the last two days of monthly expiry. But this time, the fall with higher volatility shows cautiousness among market participants before the Budget.â Additionally, corporate earnings are coming out better than expected. But profit-booking is seen in most companies that have declared results so far, barring a few cases, Oza said. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 25 closed lower while five ended with gains. Data on the BSE showed that just three stocks â HDFC Bank, HDFC and Reliance Industries â accounted for half of the sensexâs slide. Among the gainers were ITC, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech, which cushioned the fall to a minor extent. In the broader market, the advance-decline ratio was nearly 1:2 with 1,016 advances to 1,899 declines, BSE data showed. The dayâs slide also left investors poorer by Rs 2.7 lakh crore with the BSEâs market capitalisation now at Rs 189.4 lakh crore. From its all-time high of about Rs 198 lakh crore, the market cap is down by about Rs 8.6 lakh crore now. In the near term, the trend for the Nifty continues to be negative and the recent all-time high of 14,753 could be considered as an important top reversal pattern, HDFC Securities technical research analyst Nagaraj Shetti said in a note. âThe formation of reversal and the bearish candlestick pattern (three black crows) could signal more weakness down to 13,765 and lower in the next few sessions,â Shetti said.
