BENGALURU: United Spirits reported a net profit of Rs 230 crore in the third quarter, down 11% from the year-ago period, as consumers continued to be wary of visiting pubs, bars and restaurants. Net sales declined 3.6%, an improvement compared to the 6.6% drop in the second quarter. âThird quarter reflects improving consumer sentiment, notwithstanding on-premise footfalls still being low, the route to market change in Andhra Pradesh and taxation-led price hikes post-Covid,â CEO Anand Kripalu said. âDespite a quicker rebound than originally expected, in the near term there are still reasons to remain cautious and, consequently, the company is not providing quantitative guidance for FY21,â Kripalu added. Gross margin was up 24bps to 44.6% due to lower commodity prices.
