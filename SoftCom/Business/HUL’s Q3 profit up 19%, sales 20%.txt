Mumbai: In a set of financials that reveal that the worst might be over, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported 19% growth in net profit to Rs 1,921 crore in the quarter ended December 2020, while turnover rose 20% to Rs 11,969 crore. Domestic consumer growth (excluding the GSK Consumer merger) of 7% was driven by increased mobility since lifting of the lockdown and better economic activity. The same was at -7% in the June quarter. Discretionary categories, which suffered a setback due to the lockdown, have shown significant improvement in growth in the December quarter. However, the volume growth of 4% is lower as compared to 5% in the year-ago period. HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta said the rapid rollout of vaccines will give further impetus to economic growth. âAs mobility improves, demand would come back. The near-term demand outlook is improving, and we expect to see revival in urban, while rural markets should continue to do well,â said Mehta. In many ways, FMCG reflects the sentiment of the country. Mehta said any stimulus on demand in the Budget is bound to give dividends. âWe look forward to this in the coming Budget,â said Mehta. HUL CFO Srinivas Phatak, who is slated to take over as executive VP â financial controller and risk management at parent Unilever, said HULâs fundamentals remain strong with 86% of the business gaining penetration. âHealth, hygiene and nutrition, which contribute almost 80% of the portfolio, continue to grow in double digits and we have seen significant improvement in discretionary categories.â Home care, which contributes 29% of turnover, continues to be in the negative territory (-2%), while beauty & personal care and food & refreshments grew at 9% and 19%, respectively. Given the rise in commodity inflation, price increases contributed 3% to domestic consumer growth. Although inflationary pressures are high, Srinivas said the company âwill accelerate investments in innovation and advertising & promotion and maintain our competitivenessâ. HUL, which had raised soap prices by 2.5% in the December quarter, is taking yet another round of 2.5% hikes. At the same time, HULâs expenditure on advertising & promotion rose 19% to Rs 1,392 crore during the quarter. âIf one has to take the cost impact, one will need a total price increase of 7-9%. One needs to be judicious in price increases. If these levels of inflation sustain, we will have to look at price increases in select large categories,â said Srinivas, who will be succeeded by Ritesh Tiwari as the companyâs executive director finance & CFO with effect from May 1. Overall, the FMCG industry growth has revived from -17% in June quarter of 2020 to 5% in the December quarter. âFrom an e-commerce perspective, we are happy with the kind of growth we are seeing. The business, which used to be 3% of our turnover, is now 5%,â said Mehta.
