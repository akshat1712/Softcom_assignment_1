PESHAWAR: The owner of film legend Raj Kapoorâs ancestral home in Peshawar has refused to sell the building at the rate fixed by the provincial Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, saying the prime-location property has been undervalued. Earlier in the month, the provincial government had approved the release of Rs 1.5 crore for Kapoorâs home, with the aim to turn it into a museum in honour of the movie star. Haji Ali Sabir, the present owner of the haveli, on Wednesday, flatly refused to sell the property at Rs 1.5 crore. âEven half a Marla land in the area is not available for Rs 1.5 crore. How can I sell the sixmarla property for Rs 1.5 crore?â he said. Marla, a traditional unit of area used in India and Pakistan , is considered as equal to 272.25 square feet. Sabir said the right valuation of the house is Rs 200 crore. The property, known as Kapoor Haveli, was built between 1918 and 1922 by the actorâs grandfather. Raj Kapoor was born there. PTI
