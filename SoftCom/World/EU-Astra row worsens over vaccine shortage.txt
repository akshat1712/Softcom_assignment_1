BRUSSELS: The European Unionâs dispute with AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies intensified on Wednesday as the drugmaker defended itself against claims that it had reneged on contractual commitments and the two sides sparred over plans for further talks. Astra-Zeneca CEO Pascal Soriot addressed the dispute for the first time, rejecting the EUâs assertion that the company was failing to honour its commitments to deliver vaccines. Soriot said delivery figures in AstraZenecaâs contract with the EU were targets, not firm commitments, and they couldnât be met because of problems in rapidly expanding production capacity. âOur contract is not a contractual commitment,â Soriot said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. âItâs a best effort. Basically we said weâre going to try our best, but we canât guarantee weâre going to succeed.â The EU, stung by its slow progress on vaccinations, threatened this week to tighten rules on the shipment of Belgianmade shots to Britain. British lawmakers, in turn, have accused their European counterparts of a blackmail campaign that could embitter ties. The spat has raised concerns about vaccine nationalism, as nations jockey for limited supplies of the precious vaccine shots.
