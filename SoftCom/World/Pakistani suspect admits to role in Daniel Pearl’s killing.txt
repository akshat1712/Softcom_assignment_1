ISLAMABAD: After 18 years of denial, the Pakistani suspect convicted and later acquitted in the 2002 beheading of American journalist Daniel Pearl has told a court he played a âminorâ role in the killing, the Pearl family lawyer said on Wednesday. A letter handwritten by Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh in 2019, in which he admits limited involvement in the killing of the Wall Street Journal reporter, was submitted to Pakistanâs Supreme Court nearly two weeks ago. It wasnât until Wednesday that Sheikhâs lawyers confirmed their client wrote it. The stunning turn of events came as a Pakistani HC is hearing an appeal of a lower courtâs acquittal of Sheikh, who was initially charged with murder in the beheading of Pearl. The appeal was filed by Pearlâs family and the Pakistan government. Nowhere in the three-page letter addressed to the Sindh High Court did Sheikh elaborate or say exactly what his allegedly âminorâ role in Pearlâs slaying involved. Pearl family attorney Faisal Siddiqi called Sheikhâs confirmation that he wrote the letter a âdramatic developmentâ and demanded the conviction and the death sentence for Sheikh be reinstated. âThis is very, very important because for the last 18 years the position of Omar Saeed Sheikh was that he did not know Danny Pearl, he never met Danny Pearl,â Siddiqi said. âHe has not asked that he be acquitted. He accepts his guilt but asks that his sentence may be reduced,â he added. In the letter, Sheikh writes that âmy role in this matter was a relatively minor one, which does not warrant the death sentence.â A copy of the letter was obtained by the AP. However, Sheikhâs lawyer, Mehmood A. Sheikh, insisted that his client wrote the letter under duress and that he did not know or have any connection to Pearl. AP
