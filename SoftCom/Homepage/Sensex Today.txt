On NSE, except for Nifty IT, all sub-indices finished in red with Nifty Realty, Media, PSU Bank, Financial Services plunging up to 8.16 per cent.

Presenting the Union Budget, Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to remove dividend distribution tax (DDT) on companies, effectively shifting the tax burden to recipients at the applicable rate. She said certain government securities will be open for foreign investors, adding that the Centre plans to increase investment limit for FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent. The government also pegged fiscal deficit at 3.8 per cent in the current fiscal, compared to the earlier target of 3.3 per cent of GDP. It estimated nominal GDP growth for 2020-21 at 10 per cent.
