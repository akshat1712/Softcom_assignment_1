NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi had asked then Vice President Hamid Ansari why bills were not being passed in a din during a conversation when the PM dropped into the latterâs office when Ansari was chairman of Rajya Sabha, the ex-diplomat has written in his just released book. Writing about his decision not to allow passage of bills in a din, Ansari said both UPA and NDA were unhappy but the BJP coalition felt âits majority in Lok Sabha gave it the âmoralâ right to prevail over procedural impediments in Rajya Sabha. âAn expression of this was conveyed to me authoritatively, and somewhat unusually, when one day PM Modi walked into my Rajya Sabha office unscheduled.â âAfter I got over my surprise, I made the customary gestures of hospitality. He said âthere are expectations of higher responsibilities for you but you are not helping meâ. I said that my work in the Rajya Sabha, and outside, is public knowledge. âWhy are bills not being passed in the din?â he asked,â the former VP wrote. Ansari shared an uneasy relationship with the Modi government and the PM. An unusual mention during the former VPâs farewell in Rajya Sabha suggested he had remained constricted by his experience. âA big part of your working life was in West Asia... in the same atmosphere and debate... after retirement, it was minorities commission or AMU... that was your circumferenceâ. In his book âBy Many A Happy Accidentâ, Ansari speaks of Indiaâs descent in recent years into âpopulism, assisted by authoritarianism, nationalism and majoritarianismâ. Recalling a meeting with Modi in 2007, Ansari writes : âA very early caller was Narendra Modi, then CM of Gujarat. After the usual polite exchanges, I said I had questions in my mind that would have been asked had we met in my previous responsibility as Chairman of the NMC. I referred to the post-Godhra happenings in his state in 2002 and asked why he allowed it to happen. He said people look at only one aspect of the matter and pay no attention to the good work he has initiated, particularly for the education of Muslim girls. I sought its details and suggested that he should publicise it; âthat does not suit me politicallyâ was the revealingly candid response.â Describing his stint as Rajya Sabha chairman, Ansari said he built cross-party consensus over not allowing bills to be âpassed in the dinâ. Informed âauthoritativelyâ about the problems this caused, he referred to demands by NDA floor managers. âWith a paper majority, the bills at times were cleared with voice vote, provided no one asked for the division of votes. However, in the current case, the ruling NDA did not have the majority. So, it was technically, procedurally and morally impossible to pass the bills in din, assuming the majority for the government,â Ansari wrote. The former VP referred also to the worrying âemergenceâ of a practice of âusing the provisions of Articles 109 and 110 of the Constitution relating to money billsâ to declare a bill a Money Bill. In the concluding chapter of his autobiography, he cautioned against succumbing to the temptation of the âenforced homogenisation being attempted in a social milieu traditionally enriched by its diversity between communities and within themâ. He warns âthis ideological potion, premised simplistically on the desirability of oneness of language, ethnicity, religion, territory and culture was administered successfully to a little over a third of the electorateâ.
