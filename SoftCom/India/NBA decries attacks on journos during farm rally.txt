NEW DELHI: The News Broadcastersâ Association on Wednesday condemned attacks on mediapersons and breaking of their equipment while they were reporting the farmersâ tractor rally in the national capital on January 26. NBA said it is of the opinion that both print and electronic media have been covering the farmersâ protests on the outskirts of Delhi in a âfair, balanced and objective manner during the last two monthsâ. âNBA wants to state that mediapersons who were covering Tuesdayâs tractor rally were performing their professional duty of collecting information and disseminating them to the public at large, and any use of force and violence against them is tantamount to throttling the voice of democracy and the freedom of media,â an NBA statement said. It demanded that âpersons or hooligansâ responsible for the attack on journalists must be identified and booked under law since they were obstructing mediapersons from performing their duties and were âtrampling upon their rights as enshrined in Constitution
