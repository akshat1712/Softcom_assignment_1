NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday took just two minutes to stay a Bombay high court order, which had acquitted a man of charges under the Pocso Act on the specious logic that groping a 12-year-old girl without removing her clothes was not sexual assault though it convicted him under the IPC provision for outraging her modesty. The Nagpur bench of Bombay HC had sparked outrage on January 19 by acquitting the accused under Section 8 of the Pocso Act, while maintaining his conviction for outraging the modesty of the girl under IPCâs Section 354. In February last year, a Nagpur trial court had sentenced the man to three years imprisonment under Pocso Act as also under Section 354 of IPC. Times ViewThe Supreme Court has rightly stayed the HC judgment which many found disturbing and drew sharp protest from several child rights activists. This underlines again the crying need for sensitisation of all levels of the justice system to sexual harassment issues.Attorney general KKVenugopal termed the order âunprecedentedâ. âIt is a very disturbing judgment that sets a new rule that in the absence of skin-to-skin contact, that is groping a child without removing her clothes, would not amount to sexual assault under... the Pocso Act. It sets a dangerous precedent,â he said. After hearing the AG, a bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, âWe permit the AG to file a petition against the judgment. In the meantime, we stay the acquittal of the accused.â
