CHANDIGARH: Abhay Singh Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) resigned as a Haryana legislator on Wednesday in solidarity with the protesting farmers, becoming the first politician to do so. The MLA from Sirsa districtâs Ellenabad seat and younger son of former CM Om Prakash Chautala submitted his resignation to assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta, who confirmed accepting it. This will force yet another by-election, after Baroda last November. Asked if he would re-contest, Abhay said he would consult the people of Ellenabad but this resignation was against the Centreâs three agri-marketing laws and against BJPâs registering âfalse casesâ against the protesting farmers. He also blamed BJP for the violence during the farmersâ Republic Day tractor parade in Delhi. He had said earlier that he would resign in case the Union government failed to end the standoff with the farmers till January 26.
