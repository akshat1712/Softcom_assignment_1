NEW DELHI: Even as India vaccinated over 23 lakh healthcare workers, with nearly three lakh recipients vaccinated on the 12th day since the launch of the drive, 79% of the recipients on Wednesday were from five states, official data showed. The data underlines the need for other states to pick up pace. The five states accounting for majority share of vaccine recipients on Wednesday include Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Karnataka. While Rajasthan topped the list for the day with 71,632 recipients receiving the shots, Madhya Pradesh vaccinated 60,194 people. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh together accounted for 44% of total 2,99,299 recipients immunised against Covid-19 across the country on Wednesday. Karnataka â which has vaccinated the largest number of health workers so far â vaccinated 33,124 recipients, accounting for around 11% of the dayâs total count. Around 123 adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) were reported. Total nine deaths have been reported so far. However, none of the deaths have been causally linked with Covid-19 vaccination, the health ministry said. âIn the last 24 hours, one person aged 23 years, a resident of Odisha, has died. The postmortem report is awaited,â it said.
