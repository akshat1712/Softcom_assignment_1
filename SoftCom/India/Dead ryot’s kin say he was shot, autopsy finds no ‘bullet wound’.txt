RAMPUR: A day after a young farmer from UPâs Rampur died during the protests in Delhi, his family said that they saw a gunshot wound â a hole in his jaw and one just above his ear, close to the skull â though police said the autopsy report found no bullet injury. âNavreet Singh, son of Sahab Singh from Dibdiba village of Rampur, has died during farmersâ protest in Delhi. The autopsy report suggested that he sustained antemortem injuries and no bullet wound was found,â Rampur additional SP Sansaar Singh told TOI on Wednesday. On Tuesday, police had released a video in which the tractor that Navreet Singh, 24, rode was seen turning turtle. He was later found dead. In Dibdiba, his family countered the police statement. âWeâre yet to receive the official report,â his grandfather Hardeep Singh Dibdiba said. âI know he died of a bullet injury. I saw the body. Those who say he died because the tractor turned turtle donât know what they are saying. For three hours, he lay on the road and no one took him to hospitalâ¦ This is murderâ¦ I donât trust the autopsy report.â Navreetâs uncle Inderjeet Singh said the absence of other injuries on the body was also suspicious: âThere were no injuries other than the gunshot wound that pierced his left chin and came out near the right ear. It seems he was already dead when the tractor turned turtle.â A video of the body, meanwhile, started circulating on social media. âThereâs a 99% chance this is a bullet injury. Through and through, which happens in two cases â stabbing and bullet wounds. Stab wounds are not inverted (protruding) like this one is. The bullet seems to have been shot from 15-20-ft away with what could be a .32 revolver. Police usually have .38. This does not seem to be that,â a UP-based doctor who has conducted autopsies for over 15 years said. (With inputs from Yudhvir Rana in Amritsar)
