NEW DELHI: More than a month after the results of the first District Development Council (DDC) election results were announced, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti arrived in Jammu on Wednesday to meet senior party leaders and chalk out a future strategy. She will spend about a week in Jammu. The DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir were held in November and December and counting of votes were undertaken on December 23. The results gave cheers to both the main contenders, the BJP and the seven-party Peopleâs Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD or the Gupkar Alliance) led by National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah. The Gupkar Alliance won 110 of the 280 seats while the BJP became the single-largest party by winning 75 seats. PAGD bagged the maximum pre-poll alliance seats. The BJP garnered the maximum number of votes - in fact, more than PAGD and the Congress combined. Among the PAGD constituents, NC was victorious on maximum number of seats. Out of the 280 seats - 140 each in the Kashmir Valley and the Jammu region - the BJP emerged as the single-largest party by winning 75 seats. While Farooq Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) won 67 seats, PDP bagged 27 and the Congress 26. In the backdrop of these results, Mehbooba Muftiâs first visit to Jammu holds significance. "Mehbooba Mufti has arrived in Jammu. She will be holding threadbare discussions with district units over the next week with a focus on party affairs and the future strategy," PDP spokesperson Firdous Ahmad Tak told agencies. During her visit, Mehbooba will visit the border districts of Poonch and Rajouri, and the Chenab Valley region to interact with party leaders and workers, he said. She will also visit the bereaved family of former minister Sardar Rafiq Khan in Poonch to express her condolences, the PDP spokesperson said. The 85-year-old leader breathed his last on January 20.
