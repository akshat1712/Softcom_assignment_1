WAN TARA SINGH (TARN TARAN): Jugraj Singhâs family members and some villagers, who were earlier excited about him allegedly hoisting the Khalsa flag atop the Red Fort, sounded somewhat regretful and fearful of possible police action on Wednesday. Jugraj, a 23-year-old from Wan Tara Singh, is believed to have hoisted the Nishan Sahib on the ramparts of the Red Fort on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Jugrajâs parents allegedly fled their village, leaving behind his grandparents to face the police and media. âBari kripa hai Babae di, bahut sohan haiâ was the reaction of Jugrajâs grandfather, Mehal Singh, on Tuesday when he was asked how he felt about his grandsonâs alleged act. However, a day later, while responding to the same question, Mehal Singh replied: âWe donât know what or how it happened, he is a decent boy who never gave us any reason to complain.â Villagers said police had âraidedâ Jugrajâs house several times and returned empty-handed. A village elder, Prem Singh, who was also present at Mehalâs house, said that he had watched the incident on TV. âJugrajâs act is definitely an unfortunate one, but this young and innocent boy didnât know the consequences of hoisting a flag in such a manner on Lal Qila. But then it was a spontaneous act and not a planned one, I myself saw on TV that the flags were already fluttering on tractors. Somebody gave him a flag and prompted him to hoist it and he climbed to the top,â Prem Singh claimed, adding that Jugraj was a hardworking boy.
